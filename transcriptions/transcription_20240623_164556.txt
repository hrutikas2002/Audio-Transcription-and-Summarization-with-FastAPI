 Americans can vote from here, here, and well, anywhere actually. With absentee ballots, Americans have the right to vote in U.S. elections even when they live abroad. Absentee voting was used as far back as the Civil War and again during World War II, allowing members of the military to cast their ballots while on the front lines. In the years since, laws have been passed making it easier not just for U.S. military, but their families and U.S. citizens living abroad to vote absentee. Whether it's voting electronically, through the mail, or by visiting U.S. embassies and consulates, U.S. citizens never have to miss an election. The right to vote is guaranteed to all Americans and is a crucial part of our democratic system. Allowing U.S. citizens overseas to vote ensures that every American, no matter where they live, can let their voice be heard. you
